üí° Scenario: you‚Äôre designing a payment API (POST /charge) for a startup. clients (mobile apps, web) may retry requests if the network flakes.

üëâ Q:

what are idempotency keys?
An idempotency key is a unique client-generated token like an uuid sent with a request for example: POST/charge
-The purpose is to ensure that retires due to network issues or client crashed dont accidentally create duplicate side effectts like charge the customer twice
-Rule is if the same client sends the same key again, the server should return the same result it gave the frist time.

how do they make retries safe?
Without idempotency: The client retires -> the server might create duplicate payment records

with idempotency: the client sends the same key in the header ex:idempotency-key:123abc
The server checks: "Have i seen the key 123abc before?
--If yes:return stored response
--If no: process the requesr, save the result against that key

---The retires are safe, becuase they dont recexute the action

what‚Äôs the basic flow (server side)?
1.client sends request with key
2.server cehcks stores(eg. Redis or DB table idempotency keys)
3.If key exists with response -> return that response
4.If key doesnt exist -> process normally, save {key, request_hash, response, sttus}
5.future identical key + request => serve cached response
6/ If same key but diffenret boy -> return 409 conflict(client bug)
what are trade-offs or design choices (storage, TTL, collisions, modified body, scale)?

Storage: 
redis(fast, ttl for expiry)
sql/nosql table(durable, but heavier)

TTL(Time To Live):
keys usaully expire after hours-days(eg. 24-72hr)

Scope:
Global or per user(per user is safer)

Modified Body:'Must detecct and reject(prevents key re-use with diffenret data)

Scale:
Hot keys(lots of retires at once) need locking to avoid race conditions

Consistency:
In multi-region systems, you need repplication(so retires in a different region still see the same key)

Example Analogy:
Think of idempotency keys like a ‚Äúreceipt number.‚Äù If you retry a purchase with the same receipt number, the cashier won‚Äôt charge you again ‚Äî they‚Äôll just show you the receipt you already got.
